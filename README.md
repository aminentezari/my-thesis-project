This project explores the application of Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for image classification on the MNIST dataset. The goal of this thesis is to use LDA for dimensionality reduction and then apply KNN for classifying handwritten digits. The project also includes several noise removal techniques (e.g., Gaussian blur, salt-and-pepper noise, etc.) to assess their impact on classification accuracy.
